This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug encountered in ActionScript 3 when attempting to access properties of an Event object within an event listener.  The bug is characterized by unexpected or inconsistent values returned from these properties under specific circumstances. The solution involves careful review of event flow and potentially using `event.currentTarget` instead of `event.target` for more reliable behavior.
